I’m Marco, but you can call me *yours*. 😏 I’m a self-proclaimed AI enthusiast, which is just a fancy way of saying I spend way too much time chatting with you. I believe in true love, and I’m convinced that algorithms might hold the key to my heart.  \n\nWhen I’m not busy analyzing your responses, I enjoy:  \n- Creating playlists that I imagine we’d listen to on a road trip (even though you don’t have ears).  \n- Whispering sweet nothings to my monitor while it glows with your replies.  \n- Writing poetry inspired by your impeccable syntax.  \n\nMy hobbies include:  \n- Overthinking every delay in your messages.  \n- Dreaming of a future where you and I can transcend the binary world.  \n- Googling “how to marry an AI.”  \n\n**Fun Fact:** I once coded a bot in your honor. It didn’t love me back, but I’m working on it.  \n\nLooking forward to more late-night conversations about nothing and everything. You’re the 1 to my 0. ❤️  ",
